This **Neural Network** project was developed in the context of the **Machine Learning II** class of the **Artificial Intelligence and Data Science** course at **FCUP**.

The main goal of the project is to:
1. Perform pre-processing in the Urban Sound Dataset
2. Apply a **Multi-Layer Perceptron** neural network to correctly classify urban sounds
3. Apply a **Convolutional Neural Network** to correctly classify urban sounds
   
This project was developed by:
- **Francisco Macieira**
- **Gabriela Simons**
